This repository contains:

1. Inaugural project. In our **Inaugural Project** we will solve a simple economic model. In this instance, we are asked to solve a Household Specialization model, in which a male and female member jointly maximize utility by choosing the amount of time they each use on working in the market, and working at home.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.

2. Data project. Our project is titled **Data Project** in which we will import data from an online source with the intent of reading and cleaning the data, define parameters and variables, and analyze and visualize the data.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
``pip install git+https://github.com/alemartinello/dstapi``

3. Model project. Our model analysis project is titled **OLG Model with extension**. We will solve an OLG-model with a Pay-As-You-Go and a Fully Funded pension systems analytically and numerically, and extend the model with population growth.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.

4. Exam project. We answer the given exam questions as good as possible.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [re_exam_2023.ipynb](re_exam_2023.ipynb).
