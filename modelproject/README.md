# Model analysis project

Our model analysis project is titled **OLG Model with extension**. We will solve an OLG-model with a Pay-As-You-Go system analytically and numerically, and extend the model with a Fully-Funded scheme.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
