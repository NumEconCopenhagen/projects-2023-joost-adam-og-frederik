# Inaugural project

In our **Inaugural Project** we will solve a simple economic model. In this instance, we are asked to solve a Household Specialization model, in which a male and female member jointly maximize utility by choosing the amount of time they each use on working in the market, and working at home.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
