# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Data Project** in which we will import data from an online source with the intent of reading and cleaning the data, define parameters and variables, and analyze and visualize the data.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. dataX.csv (*source*) 
1. dataY.csv (*source*)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
